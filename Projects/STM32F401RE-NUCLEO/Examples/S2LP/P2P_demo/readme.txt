@par Example Description

  This example is to demonstrate Point-to-Point communication using Spirit1/ S2-LP 
  driver and STM32Cube firmware. 
 
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo devices with SPIRIT1 or S2-LP expansion board
    - SPIRIT1: (X-NUCLEO-IDS01A4 for 868 MHz or X-NUCLEO-IDS01A5 for 915 MHz)
    - S2-LP: (X-NUCLEO0-S2868A1 for 868 MHz or X-NUCLEO-S2915A1 for 915 MHz)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC board
    - NUCLEO-L152RE RevC board
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
     
  - User can select desired P2P features in radio_appli.h file located 
     @P2P_Demo/Inc

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - The tested tool chain and environment is explained in the Release notes
 - Open the suitable toolchain (IAR, Keil, STM32CubeIDE) and open 
    the project for the required STM32 Nucleo board
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.

 How to verify the firmware
 - Power-up the two nodes, each comprising of X-NUCLEO-IDS01A4/5 mounted on 
   STM32 Nucleo board
 - The LED LD2 on STM32 Nucleo board starts to blink
 - User can press user button B1 (Blue Colour) on any of the STM32 Nucleo board
    This causes a command packet to be sent from the node (Node1) to Node2
 - The successful communication with the other node will cause a LED on 
   the receiving node (Node2) to blink
 - The receiving node (Node2) will acknowledge the command by sending an RF 
    packet and this can be seen by blink of a LED on the node-1 
 
    To summarise:
    
    *1*  User presses B1 on Node1
    *2*  Node1  ----------- RF Command packet ------>   Node2
    *3*                                    Success = LED on Node2 Blinks
    *4*  Node1  <---------- Ack packet --------------   Node2                                                     
    *5*  Success = LED Blinks on Node1
 
 
 - IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid issues with USB connection (mandatory if you have USB 3.0), it is   
   suggested to update the ST-Link/V2 firmware for STM32 Nucleo boards to the latest version.
   Please refer to the readme.txt file in the Applications directory for details.
